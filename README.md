# Quantum Diffusion Denoising Model
This project implements a Quantum Diffusion Denoising Model using Qiskit. The goal is to iteratively remove noise from an initial quantum state, utilising custom quantum circuits and measurement techniques. This is project is based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05866)
